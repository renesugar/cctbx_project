IOTA v1.1.026 - interface updates

Bugfixes:

1. Added more descriptive error message ("No reflections left after outliers
are removed") to outlier_detection.py
2. Image tracker: went to update by timer; interface works smoother
3. More sophisticated filter for file-finding; can now filter by any keyword
4. Added an advanced 'flip_beamXY' param:
   - flips X and Y axes when cropping / padding image (orientation unaffected)
   - flips beamXY coordinates to match
   - this resolves a "beamX > beamY" bug during image modification for cctbx

Features:

1. Image tracker: Added function to write out list of inspected images to file
(user can now pick out images to process from a large dataset via inspection)
2. Added separate spotfinder thread; tracker runs a bit faster as a result


Known issues:

1. Image tracker: interface could use to be faster w/ large datasets
